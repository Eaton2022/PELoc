## Unleashing the Power of Data Generation in One-Pass Outdoor LiDAR Localization  (ACM MM 2025)
------
ðŸ“Œ This repository contains the official implementation of our paper.

# PELoc
------
**PELoc** is the first LiDAR-based localization algorithm designed for **single-trajectory localization**.  
It achieves **near sub-meter accuracy** on most test trajectories of **QEOxford** and **NCLT** datasets.  
The core of PELoc lies in **pose enhancement**.

## Experimental Results
------
- We provide experimental results for **Oxford**, **QEOxford**, and **NCLT** datasets in the `log` directory.  We provide QEOxford_pose_stats_PELoc.txt in the QEOxford folder, thus you can use our pretrained model to test performance in QEOxford dataset.
- 
- Pretrained model weights are available on Baidu Netdisk:

### LTI Usage
------
PELoc selects **2019-01-11-14-02-26** for Oxford/QEOxford  and **2012-02-18** for NCLT.  

We first use **LTI** to generate two additional trajectories offline.  You need to prepare both the **point cloud data** and the **pose files**,  then run the Python scripts in the `LTI` folder.

We provide two interpolation methods.  The LTI implementations for **NCLT** and **Oxford/QEOxford** have some differences,  but both significantly improve the accuracy of single-trajectory localization.

The **LTI_q** version achieves better accuracy improvement,  while the standard **LTI** version is more suitable for integration with **KP-CL**.  We will later upload our simulated point clouds to a cloud drive for download. You can also generate simulated point cloud trajectories by yourself.


### Two Versions of PELoc
------
1. **PELoc-quick**  
   This version only requires **SSDA**, **LTI**, and optionally **RFT** for training.  It achieves high accuracy with much faster training speed.  You can use a batch size of **100** for this version.  

2. **PELoc-full**  
   This version additionally incorporates **KP-CL** during training.   It requires more training time, but achieves higher localization accuracy.

In the full code release, we provide the **PELoc-full** version. If you want to accelerate training, you may skip using **KP-CL**.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: If you are using the **PELoc-quick** version,  we recommend using the **LTI_q** version for generating simulated trajectories.
